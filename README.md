# Standardized GVI
Calculate standardized GVI from GVI point data / original road network data / boundary data.

## Prepare a virtual environment
Due to dependency of rtree, install spatialindex via homebrew.

`brew install spatialindex`

Once spatialindex is installed, install all the other libraries.
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This is a test.
